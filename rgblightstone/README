Depends: mesecons_lightstone, digilines
(neither is in depends.txt since the order doesn't matter)

Instructions:

* Grab one from the creative inventory, or craft one:
	nothing		green lightstone	nothing
	red lightstone	luacontroller		blue lightstone
	nothing		digiline		nothing

* Place the thing
* Right-click and set a channel
* Send a digilines message to it on that channel with the color you want (choices listed below)

Colors available: Any 6-digit hex color, such as "FF0000", "#c0ffee", "123456"... (will be set to the nearest color available)

Group addressing mode:

If you are building something with large numbers of these things, set them all to the same channel, set X and Y addresses on each, and send nested tables (Y on the outside) with colors for all of them.
For example, given this display:

X=1 Y=1     X=2 Y=1

X=1 Y=2     X=2 Y=2

to make it show:

red     green
blue    yellow

send this:

{{"red","green"},
{"blue","yellow"}}

Note that if you are using group addressing mode, if there is an already-configured RGB lightstone node directly above the one you are setting up,
punching the one you are setting up (or right-clicking and selecting the Auto-Fill option) will attempt to auto-fill it (incrementing the Y address) from the one above.
