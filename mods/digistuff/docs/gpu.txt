Digilines 2D Graphics Processor
===============================

Commands for this part are in the form of a table, consisting of a field called "command" with the command to be executed, and other fields supplying parameters to the command.
Example:
	{command="send",buffer=0,channel="example"}

Up to 32 commands may be sent at once by placing all of the tables into one.
Example:
	{
		{command="createbuffer",buffer=0,xsize=16,ysize=16,color="aaaaaa"},
		{command="send",buffer=0,channel="example"}
	}
	
Invalid commands or commands with missing/invalid parameters will be ignored.

Command: createbuffer
---------------------

Creates a new buffer. Up to 8 buffers may exist at one time, and each can be up to 64x64 pixels in size.

Parameters:
buffer [integer 0-7]: The slot number to create the new buffer in. If the slot is already occupied, the existing contents will be erased.
xsize [integer 1-64]: The width of the new buffer in pixels.
ysize [integer 1-64]: The height of the new buffer in pixels.
color [hex color, default "000000"]: A color to fill the new buffer with.

Command: send
-------------

Sends the contents of a buffer to a digiscreen, rgblightstone panel, or other digilines device.

Parameters:
buffer [integer 0-7]: The buffer to send the contents of.
channel [string]: The digilines channel to send the message on.

Command: sendregion
-------------------

Sends part of the contents of a buffer to a digiscreen, rgblightstone panel, or other digilines device.

Parameters:
buffer [integer 0-7]: The buffer to send part of the contents of.
channel [string]: The digilines channel to send the message on.
x1 [integer 1-64]: The X position of the left side of the region to send.
x2 [integer 1-64]: The X position of the right side of the region to send.
y1 [integer 1-64]: The Y position of the top side of the region to send.
y2 [integer 1-64]: The Y position of the bottom side of the region to send.

Command: drawrect
-----------------

Draws a rectangle with optional border on a buffer.

Parameters:
buffer [integer 0-7]: The buffer to draw the rectangle on.
x1 [integer 1-64]: The X position of the left side of the rectangle.
x2 [integer 1-64]: The X position of the right side of the rectangle.
y1 [integer 1-64]: The Y position of the top side of the rectangle.
y2 [integer 1-64]: The Y position of the bottom side of the rectangle.
fill [hex color, default "000000"]: The color of the rectangle.
edge [hex color, default same as fill]: The color of the outside edge of the rectangle.

Command: drawpoint
------------------

Draws a point on a buffer.
This command is intended for use when writing a single pixel at a time.
For writing large blocks at one time, it is recommended to use the "load" command instead.

Parameters:
buffer [integer 0-7]: The buffer to draw the point on.
x [integer 1-64]: The X position of the point.
y [integer 1-64]: The Y position of the point.
color [hex color, default "000000"]: The color of the point.

Command: copy
-------------

Perform a BitBLT operation (such as copying one buffer to another).

Parameters:
src [integer 0-7]: The buffer to copy from.
dst [integer 0-7]: The buffer to copy to. May be the same or different from "src".
srcx [integer 1-64]: The X position of the left side of the region to copy from.
srcy [integer 1-64]: The Y position of the top side of the region to copy from.
dstx [integer 1-64]: The X position of the left side of the region to copy to.
dsty [integer 1-64]: The Y position of the top side of the region to copy to.
xsize [integer 1-64]: The width of the region to copy.
ysize [integer 1-64]: The height of the region to copy.
mode [string from list below, default "normal"]: The blend mode to use for the copy operation.
transparent [hex color, default "000000"]: The color to treat as transparency when using the "overlay" blend mode. No effect in other modes.

Blend modes:
normal: Copy the source to the destination, overwriting the destination.
nop: Do nothing.
overlay: Same as normal, but skip pixels in the source matching the "transparent" color.
add: For each subpixel (red, green, blue) add the source values to the destination and write the sum to the destination.
sub: For each subpixel (red, green, blue) subtract the source values from the destination and write the difference to the destination.
isub: For each subpixel (red, green, blue) subtract the destination values from the source and write the difference to the destination.
average: For each subpixel (red, green, blue) calculate the average of the source and destination and write the average to the destination.
and: Perform a bitwise AND of the source and destination and write the result to the destination.
or: Perform a bitwise OR of the source and destination and write the result to the destination.
nand: Perform a bitwise NAND of the source and destination and write the result to the destination.
nor: Perform a bitwise NOR of the source and destination and write the result to the destination.
xor: Perform a bitwise XOR of the source and destination and write the result to the destination.
xnor: Perform a bitwise XNOR of the source and destination and write the result to the destination.
not: Perform a bitwise NOT of the source and write the result to the destination.
rgbtohsv: Convert the source from the RGB color system to the HSV color system and write the result to the destination, storing hue as "red", saturation as "green", and value as "blue".
hsvtorgb: Convert the source from the HSV color system to the RGB color system, reading hue from the red channel, saturation from the green channel, and value from the blue channel, and write the result to the destination.

Command: load
-------------

Transfer a bitmap image into a buffer.
The width and height of the image will be automatically determined from the data given.

Parameters:
buffer [integer 0-7]: The buffer to write the image into.
x [integer 1-64]: The X position of the left side of the image.
y [integer 1-64]: The Y position of the top side of the image.
data [2D array of hex color values, default for each is transparency]: The bitmap image to write.

Command: text
-------------

Draw one or more text characters on a buffer.
The font being used is 5*12 pixels in size, with one pixel spacing between characters.

Parameters:
buffer [integer 0-7]: The buffer to draw the text on.
x [integer 1-64]: The X position of the left side of the text.
y [integer 1-64]: The Y position of the right side of the text.
color [hex color, default "ff6600"]: The color of the text.
text: The text string to draw.
